# Chord Constructor 
This package started out of need. 

When I was writting a Web App which suggested
random chords to play, I found myself in need of a really big list of chords

* Now, you may ask yourself: *How many chords do you want?*

* The answer is: **Yes**

I wanted every chord I could think of, and since I coulnd't find anything that
delivered them in JSON, I got to work 

## Tl;dr: 
This packages exports a function: getChords() which returns the specified 
amount of chords, starting on the specified note
